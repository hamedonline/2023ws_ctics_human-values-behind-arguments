People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.'  The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.\")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish the European Council\", in favor of, \"Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way.   The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election. \")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish the European Council\", in favor of, \"Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.\")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish unanimity voting\", in favor of, \"Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.\")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish unanimity voting\", against, \"The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.\")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish unanimity voting\", in favor of, \"Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.\")\n",
      "(\"We should abolish unanimity voting\", in favor of, \"Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.\")\n",
      "(\"We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees\", in favor of, \"In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport. \")\n",
      "(\"We should ban unpaid internships in the EU\", against, \"This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.\")\n",
